I've' used all 3 standard operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. They're all good. My preference is Linux.

Currently I'm using [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/) for its preconfiguration of [Jack](https://jackaudio.org/) audio connection kit and the user friendliness of Ubuntu I've grown accustomed to ever since starting with Linux.

I've also set up a preferred OS configuration using [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), which you can [copy here](./os/deb.md).

Why this?

My final semester of undergrad introduced me to computer logic in practical application. I used [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut) to calculate analyses of multivariate data in truss structures. Fortunately I was simultaneously being introduced to linear algebra (theory). For me, it was fundamental to understanding the purpose of a computer. My introductory C++ coursework without a real use-case did no such thing.

Ever since I've been on a never-ending rollercoaster of discovery.
