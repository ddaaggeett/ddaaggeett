### What is work?

Do you work? What is your work? Do I work? What is my work?

tldr: that which functions
___

The new year of 2016 started my new occupation: being home with the kids. Between my wife and I, it financially made sense after we decided it was a given that we would raise our children in-house. We find that reason alone is legitimate. One of us focuses on the mundane, low-level bedrock that enables the human side of life. The other focuses on the fuel. More dedicated focus on a role breeds more competence and dependability.

To avoid confusion as to whether or not I decided to be the primary caretaker of our children in the name of feminism, I didn't. To be blunt, feminism is a sham. I do this because it serves the interests of both me and my wife. It's purely selfish. More importantly it serves the interests of our children. Capacity to perform in these two domains face diminishing returns when neither stick to one of the domains to lead.

My work is a conglomertion of interests. My most steady money-making occupations have included restaurant work and engineering. My current work is homemaking and planning my next occupation once our children are set with general autonomy.
