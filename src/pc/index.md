My last semester of undergrad introduced me to literal computer logic in practice: [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut). Not theory, at which I failed miserably in my earlier introductory coursework: C++.

I want a computer experience that has unlimited potential tooling me with what I require, yet be objectively sufficient giving me no more than I need.

I'm currently using the following system:

Linux: [Debian 11](https://www.debian.org/download) with some [configuration](./deb.md)

- [brave browser](https://brave.com/linux/#debian-ubuntu-mint)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [atom.io](https://atom.io)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with some [configuration](./py.md)
- [obs studio](https://idroot.us/install-obs-studio-debian-11/)
