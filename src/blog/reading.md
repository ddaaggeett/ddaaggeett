I've come to learn after my formal education that the rate at which I am able to learn is nothing spectacular. My reading comprehension has never been great. My attentiveness to text words as I read stutters and I pulse other thoughts as I'm reading a sentence right in front of my eyes. Most of the time text in front of my eyes can't keep me focused to follow a thought, of course unless it was interesting enough in the moment. For me, it certainly is difficult to stay focused without the intent of discovering the potential something particular.

Here's something odd. The only few books I intently read and gained a true understanding without distraction were fundamentals of structural analysis topics while studying engineering in school. Not your typical piece of literature, and to most, not of interest. Here's another: the more I increase playback speed of audio, the more I'm able to retain focus and interest. This is so peculiar to me. I know I'm not dumb. I know I'm able to absorb complex information so long as it's of presented in the right format and of interest. I know reading in the classical manner by visually following written text is reliable, but I could imagine not unlike many others, is not reliably adaptable to some (or many) as a means for knowledge acquisition. 

Then comes YouTube, this bohemoth of auditory information. Fun fact: you're unable to cite information from the direct coverage of a phenomena in a YouTube video, but you're able to cite an article that covers the information of the content in a video. If that's not subject to unreliability of interprative transcription, then I don't know what is.

Over the last decade after college I've discovered thousands of freely available in-depth lectures and discussions covering what seems to be the entirety of general knowledge.

It's easier to notice misleading information in the spoken word than it is in written text. I don't think many people would disagree. I think this is one of the reasons why mainstream media is able to hold the reigns of pop-culture narrative. Truth seems to be held in regard to those who seemingly are better adapted to following text. It's as if knowledge is only legitimate if it's in text format and if you're the first to read it.
