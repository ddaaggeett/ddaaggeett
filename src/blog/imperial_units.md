I'm a big fan of the base-10 counting system. The decimal system is clearly the more logical approach to quantifying anything.

But I find in practice when it comes to using a measuring tape, there are countless instances where I have to rely on estimating a length finer than the 1/16th inch increment.

	"Why not use a tape measure with finer increments? Shouldn't 1/32" or 1/64" tick marks do the trick?"
	"Isn't this why you should use metric? Millimeters would make it easier to get a closer reading of your length."

Though these concerns are valid, I would contend using the unverified skill of "eyeballing" a measurement is more reliable a method than using pre-determined tick marks, and this method works better within the larger spacing of the 1/16" tick than the 1mm tick.

Unfortunately there isn't a way to replicate my thoughts as I  map a measurement to a cut, but it goes similar to the following:
