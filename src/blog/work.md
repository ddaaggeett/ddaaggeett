### What is work?

Do you work? What is your work? Do I work? What is my work?

tldr: that which functions
___

The new year of 2016 started my new occupation: being home with the kids. Between my wife and I, it made sense financially after we decided a given that we wanted to raise our children in-house. We find that alone is a legitimate reason. One focused on the mundane, the low-level bedrock that enables the human side of life. The other focused on the fuel. More dedicated focus on a role breeds more competence and dependability. So, if one of us was going to milk the cow that can bear more freedom allowing the mundane necessities, you bet your ass these were the roles we chose to play.

To avoid confusion as to whether or not I decided to be the primary caretaker of our children in the name of feminism, I didn't. To be blunt, feminism is a sham. I do this because it serves the interests of both me and my wife. It's purely selfish. More importantly it serves the interests of our children. Capacity to perform in these two domains face diminishing returns when neither stick to one of the domains to lead.

My work is a conglomertion of interests. My most steady mokey-making occupations have included restaurant work and engineering. My current work is homemaking and planning my next money-making occupation once our children are set with general autonomy.
