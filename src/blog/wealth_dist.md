I've come to learn a main concern in our economic structure resides in the ineffectiveness of its wealth distribution. Spoils of wealth generation are vastly concentrated in the hands of a few while everyone else stacks up at zero. Is this good? Is this bad? What do we do about this? I'd like to address a few ideas I consider to be general misconceptions regarding this distribution inefficiency. If I am illogical in any way, please inform me by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/ddaaggeett/ddaaggeett/issues/new/choose).

My intention is not to claim a higher interest in capitalism or socialism. In fact, after considering these thoughts, you may realize I am more socialist than those who despise capitalism and more capitalist than those who despise socialism.

Most of these thoughts are not my own but rather a collection from others who have a greater depth of knowledge of this subject. This is just a recap through the eyes of an [atypical] engineer.

We have to distinguish between different methods of wealth accumulation: quantity of income and quantity of project ownership.

We also have to distinguish between different types of income: salary and one-off gains.

The effectiveness of methods by which salaries within project structures are quantified are debatable. Wealth differentials between few executives and many workers tend to be high and result in vast differences in access to opportunity. I see the meaning of a salary for a role carried in a project is to ensure longevity of participation of a worker in the project. Worker overturn is not beneficial for project efficiency considering investment in training and cohesiveness of morale. It is also not beneficial for workers due to uncertainty in financial stability and further livelihood shock.

A salary can be considered too low if, of course, basic needs of living are not met, but also if access to spending opportunities are diminished. Diminished opportunities, though indeterminate, can have drastic effects on workers' home lives and relative cultures. I would argue diminished opportunities for workers also have an effect on the performance of the project from which a salary is earned. Project performance is dependent on worker performance which is directly influenced by salary waged. A general principle here is to consider a single salary is to be sufficient for the livelihood of a worker, just a a single worker per project role is sufficient for a project to depend. Dependency on multiple salaries is moot if we're discussing effectiveness of worker to project relations. Effectively, multiple projects per worker could only diminish worker performance.

Just as a salary can be considered too low, there are reasons to consider why a salary can be too high. As a general principle, we must consider the purpose of money earned, which is to be spent. If a salary is not spent, objectively speaking, it is wasted. I do not say this to imply all excess money unspent should not be waged, but generally speaking, ineffectiveness at spending money creates further economic issues. A consideration to determine salary waged should be relative to creativeness and effectiveness of spending money. Not every worker is capable of spending money to generate further wealth. Not every worker spends money on the same quality or quantity of products to ensure savings capacity. Not every worker is able to distinguish good expenditure versus bad expenditure. Not every wage earner evaluates market consumerism equally. Though impossible, a salary can be considered too high at the point at which the salary earner is incapable of allocating funds to further means that benefit themselves. I would be careful with the term 'benefit' due to a likely misinterpretation for lavishness or excess rather than utility. Though, how do we measure lavishness without giving due consideration to market services available to provide such excess? Are these not projects in and of themselves? Aside from these caveats of excess wealth, it can be understood why wages can possibly be too high for certain types of market consumers.

One-off gains are another form of income. Something a person has is valued by another and some trade is made at a value according to market demand. Due to the nature of one-off gains, ineffectiveness of spending the financial gain of this type of income is irrelevant, unlike a worker salary, considering its uninvolved ties to any sort of fund allocation within any project. Fund allocation of projects are meant to consider not only longevity of worker stamina, but longevity of project lifetime and capacity to develop further. One-off gains are unrelated to project funds since they are outside the domain of the projects themselves. Those who demand a product which another possesses who are willing to pay market value for acquisition typically do so for the sake of alleviating strain on project funding. So a one-off gain made by one is the project funds stress reliever of another. My best estimation regarding what is to be considered too high a gain is however in demand a product is for such one-off occurrence to happen. There is no amount too high.






I have more of a problem with the CEO of a company making millions annually than I do with the wealth of a billionaire.

Typically people with ownership of a project whose value totals in the billion dollar range are those referenced as billionaires. As a matter of principle, this ownership stake should be considered a consistent percentage claim to whatever project. Regardless the value of a project, whether it's $0 or $100 billion, 100 percent ownership of a project is just that. Whatever percentage value of ownership of a project is the percentage of influence the stakeholder is entitled to. This principle is to be considered before and amount of revenue or profits are generated by the project. Stake of project ownership is paramount in wealth of a company.
