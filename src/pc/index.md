My final semester of undergrad introduced me to computer logic in practice. I used [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut) to calculate analyses of multivariate data in truss structures. For me, along with linear algebra, it was fundamental to understanding the purpose of a computer. My introductory C++ coursework did no such thing.

I want to share my current desktop system so you can copy it exactly if you so choose. I'm currently using the following:

Linux: [Debian 11](https://www.debian.org/download) with some [configuration](./setup/index.md) after a fresh boot. To do this, you'll want to first [create a bootable USB installation disk](https://linuxhint.com/create_bootable_linux_usb_flash_drive/).
