I've' used all 3 standard operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. They're all good.

This is [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux. I use it as my primary desktop. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) Linux also does the trick which tends to be better for new Linux users. I recommend [booting these with a virtual machine](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) to test it out in your current PC before considering a full install.

**YES**, this configuration will provide the regular everyday, no-skill PC user experience. The idea Linux is not user-friendly or non-dummy-proof is entirely false. So, welcome.

 **Copy using the following**:

Debian:
1. Download the [latest .iso image](https://www.debian.org/download)
2. [create a bootable USB installation disk](https://linuxhint.com/create_bootable_linux_usb_flash_drive/) with your downloaded .iso
3.  Install Debian from your bootable USB drive. Make sure to [change your boot drive order](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-change-the-boot-order-in-the-bios-on-your-windows-pc/) to recognize your ISO disk first.

Optional configuration after a fresh boot <span>&#8680;</span> see [here](https://github.com/ddaaggeett/scripts/blob/main/src/debian/README.md)
