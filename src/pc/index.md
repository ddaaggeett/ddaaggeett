My last semester of undergrad introduced me to literal computer logic in practice: [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut). Not theory, at which I failed miserably in my earlier introductory coursework: C++.

I want a computer experience that has unlimited potential tooling me with what I require, yet be objectively sufficient giving me no more than I need.

I want to share my current desktop system so you can copy it exactly if you so choose. I'm currently using the following:

Linux: [Debian 11](https://www.debian.org/download) with some [configuration](./setup/index.md) after a fresh boot. To do this, you'll want to first [create a bootable USB installation disk](https://linuxhint.com/create_bootable_linux_usb_flash_drive/).
