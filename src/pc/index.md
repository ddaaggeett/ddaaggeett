Why this?

My final semester of undergrad introduced me to computer logic in practical application. I used [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut) to calculate analyses of multivariate data in truss structures. Fortunately I was simultaneously being introduced to linear algebra (theory). For me, it was fundamental to understanding the purpose of a computer. My introductory C++ coursework without a real use-case did no such thing.

Ever since I've been on a never-ending rollercoaster of discovery.
