## A case for the imperial `1/16"` instead of the metric `mm`

I'm a big fan of the base-10 metric system. The decimal system is clearly the more logical approach to quantifying anything.

But in practice I find when it comes to using a tape measure (with imperial units), there are countless instances where I have to rely on estimating a length finer than the 1/16th inch increment.

	"Why not use a tape measure with finer increments? Shouldn't 1/32" or 1/64" tick marks do the trick?"
	"Isn't this why you should use metric? Millimeters would make it easier to get a closer reading of your length."

Though these concerns are valid, I would contend using the unverified skill of "eyeballing" a measurement is more reliable than using pre-determined tick marks, and this method works better within the larger spacing of the 1/16" ticks than 1mm ticks.

Unfortunately there isn't a way to replicate my thoughts as I map a measurement to a cut, but it goes similar to the following as I eyeball the distance between two 1/16" ticks:

- `... and some change`
- `slightly after`
- `40% beyond`
- `20% before`

This probably wouldn't fall under best practices, but it turns out to be consistent and reliable ... for me.
