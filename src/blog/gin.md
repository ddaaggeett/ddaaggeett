### Gated Institutional Narrative

Reference: [https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Gated_Institutional_Narrative_(GIN)](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Gated_Institutional_Narrative_(GIN))

The '''gated institutional narrative''' (GIN) is an observable phenomenon pertaining to the sociological representation and utility of general public knowledge and what is also known as the commentariat.

Institutional narratives are [[Institution|institutionally]]-based sense-making structures in which are depended upon to maintain particular knowledge and expertise per area of understanding. The manner by which these institutions form interpretations and represent facts reality produces is traditionally the sociological method by which individuals make sense of the world. When an institution lies to the public because the public is unable to follow the analytic argument it claims to be making, it is the sociological equivalence of academic malpractice.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUl7-SvntQ4</ref>

Per mathematician, [[Eric Weinstein]], the gated institutional narrative is this 'academic malpractice'.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUl7-SvntQ4</ref> The GIN can be identified as institutional narratives that, for whatever reason, will exclude the participation of individuals in order to continue producing its unconfirmed sense-making apparatus for public consumption. An institution creates itself an exclusive arbiter of ideas to be had and chooses to condemn alternative sense-making collectives.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0OX6ai4Qw</ref>

The reason to exclude individuals has consistently been the pattern of purging from discussion those who interpret and represent particular literal phenomena more remarkably honest and ethically cautious than the institutions themselves.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0OX6ai4Qw</ref> In essence, an institution's condemnation of alternative analysis of what is happening in the world is the figurative 'gating' of itself from the general public.

This pattern is incidentally the direct causation of the increasing number of unofficial members of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Weinstein#Intellectual_dark_web Intellectual Dark Web] (IDW) where individuals have been excluded from conversations occurring inside these institutions.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-daum-intellectual-dark-web-20180316-story.html</ref>

The IDW is humorously named 'dark' to recognize those who essentially involuntarily become rogue/stealth as a result of being excommunicated per GIN.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0OX6ai4Qw</ref>

The result of an accelerated growth in the IDW population is a direct result of a decreased rate in amount of opportunities for discussion of intellectual matters in our traditional media outlets.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0OX6ai4Qw</ref>
