Here is a personal PC configuration you can copy. This is [Debian](https://www.debian.org/). I use it primarily for development. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) also does the trick which tends to be better for new Linux users. I recommend [booting these with a virtual machine](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview) to test it out in your current PC before considering a full install.

**YES**, this configuration will provide the regular everyday, no-skill PC user experience. The idea Linux is not user-friendly or non-dummy-proof is entirely false. So, welcome.

 **Copy using the following**:

- Linux: Debian:
	1. Download the [latest .iso image](https://www.debian.org/download)
	2. [create a bootable USB installation disk](https://linuxhint.com/create_bootable_linux_usb_flash_drive/) with your downloaded .iso
	3.  Install Debian from your bootable USB drive with a hard-wired internet connection. Make sure to [change your boot drive order](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-change-the-boot-order-in-the-bios-on-your-windows-pc/) to recognize your ISO disk first.
- **[CONFIGURATION](../setup/index.md)** after a fresh boot.
