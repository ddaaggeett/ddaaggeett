I've been searching for a computer experience that has unlimited potential tooling me with what I require, yet be objectively sufficient giving me no more than I need.

I'd like to share my current desktop system so you can copy it exactly if you so choose.

**YES**, this PC configuration will provide the regular everyday, no-skill PC user experience. The idea Linux is not user-friendly or non-dummy-proof is entirely false. If you don't have an operating system, are loaded with viruses or are done with Windows/MacOS/(Ubuntu :-D), then welcome.

 I'm currently using the following:

- Linux: Debian:
	1. Download the [latest .iso image](https://www.debian.org/download)
	2. [create a bootable USB installation disk](https://linuxhint.com/create_bootable_linux_usb_flash_drive/) with your downloaded .iso
	3.  Install Debian from your bootable USB drive with a hard-wired internet connection. Make sure to [change your boot drive order](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-change-the-boot-order-in-the-bios-on-your-windows-pc/) to recognize your ISO disk first.
- [configuration](./setup/index.md) after a fresh boot.

Why this?

My final semester of undergrad introduced me to computer logic in practical application. I used [MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/?s_tid=acb_tut) to calculate analyses of multivariate data in truss structures. Fortunately I was simultaneously being introduced to linear algebra (theory). For me, it was fundamental to understanding the purpose of a computer. My introductory C++ coursework without a real use-case did no such thing.

Ever since I've been on a never-ending rollercoaster of discovery.
