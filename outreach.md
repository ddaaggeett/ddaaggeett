If you'd like to comb through any [videos I haven't viewed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKO9AFm3pJHYh0isZV0Z3F6t-Hb4WDKDg) yet, please give me a 2 sentence reason to watch or not watch the video, please do so and [submit a new issue](https://github.com/ddaaggeett/ddaaggeett/issues/new/choose).

This playlist of videos I have not viewed is in no way reflective of what I think or what I am interested in.
